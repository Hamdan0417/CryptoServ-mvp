# CheasyInvest Documentation Hub

Use this workspace to capture Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), OpenAPI/GraphQL specifications, and operational runbooks.

## Immediate Next Steps
- PR10 will populate ADR-000 through ADR-003 and reference diagrams.
- Store generated API contracts (OpenAPI/SDL) for both REST and GraphQL here.

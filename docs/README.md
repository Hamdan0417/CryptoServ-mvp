# Crypto Serv Documentation

This folder will host architectural decision records (ADRs), API specifications, and operational runbooks.

- `ADRs/` – Decision records (ADR-000 stack selection, ADR-001 authentication, etc.).
- `api/` – REST and GraphQL schemas generated from the NestJS gateway.
- `runbooks/` – Incident response, compliance review, and deployment guides.

Bootstrap sprint (PR0) creates the documentation skeleton. Subsequent sprints will fill in detailed content.

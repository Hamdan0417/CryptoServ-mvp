## Technical Architecture
### Frontend
- Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for SSR/SSG marketing pages and authenticated dashboards.
- React Query or Apollo Client for data fetching depending on REST vs GraphQL endpoints.
- Component library built with Radix UI primitives and Storybook documentation.

### Backend & APIs
- NestJS (Node.js) as the primary application layer exposing REST + GraphQL endpoints.
- Modular services for Auth, Talent, Marketplace, Investor, and Token operations.
- API Gateway to enforce rate limiting, JWT verification, and signature validation for wallet actions.

### Blockchain & Token Infrastructure
- Solidity smart contracts deployed to EVM-compatible networks (BSC + Ethereum L2 for cost efficiency).
- Hardhat for development, Foundry for fuzz testing, OpenZeppelin libraries for security-hardened implementations.
- Oracles (Chainlink) for off-chain data feeds and price references.

### Data & Storage
- PostgreSQL for relational data with Prisma ORM.
- Redis for session caching, rate limiting tokens, and job search indexing.
- S3-compatible object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Backblaze) for documents, media, and compliance evidence.
- ElasticSearch (optional) for faceted job search and marketplace discovery.

### Integrations
- KYC/AML provider (e.g., Sumsub) via secure webhook ingestion.
- Email/SMS notifications (SendGrid, Twilio) with localization support.
- Analytics stack: Segment → BigQuery → Metabase dashboards.

### DevOps & Deployment
- Monorepo managed with Turborepo; CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform targeting AWS (EKS for services, RDS for Postgres, ElastiCache for Redis).
- Canary deployments with feature flagging (LaunchDarkly) for gradual rollouts.

## Security, Compliance & Risk

## Getting Started
```bash
# Clone and bootstrap the monorepo
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest crypto-serv
cd crypto-serv
pnpm install

# Start local services
task dev:all       # spins up web, admin, and api apps concurrently

# Run database migrations
pnpm --filter api prisma migrate dev

# Execute contract test suite
pnpm --filter contracts test
```

> **Note:** Replace the placeholder commands with the actual scripts once the monorepo scaffolding is committed. Prefer `pnpm` for workspace management to benefit from deterministic installs and caching.

# Crypto Serve Infrastructure Stack

This folder houses infrastructure-as-code assets and CI/CD automation.

## Planned Contents
- Terraform modules for cloud provisioning (networking, databases, object storage).
- Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.
- GitHub Actions workflows for lint/test/build, contract verification, and E2E suites.

The groundwork is laid in PR0; future PRs will incrementally add concrete manifests.
